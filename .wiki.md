# Project Summary
The project focuses on analyzing customer churn in the telecommunications industry, specifically using the Telco Customer Churn dataset. The goal is to identify high-risk customer segments and build predictive models to forecast churn behavior. By leveraging data analysis and machine learning techniques, the project aims to provide actionable insights that can enhance customer retention strategies, ultimately driving business growth and profitability.

# Project Module Description
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Scripts for cleaning and transforming the raw dataset to prepare it for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analysis scripts that explore the dataset, providing insights into customer behavior and churn predictors.
3. **Churn Prediction Models**: Development and evaluation of various machine learning models to predict customer churn.
