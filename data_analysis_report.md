# Telecom Customer Churn Analysis Report

## 1. Dataset Evaluation and Selection

For this telecom customer churn prediction project, I've analyzed the IBM Telco Customer Churn dataset with the following characteristics:

- **Dataset size**: 7,043 customer records with 21 features
- **Target variable**: Customer churn (26.54% churn rate, indicating class imbalance)
- **Feature categories**:
  - Customer demographics (gender, SeniorCitizen, Partner, Dependents)
  - Account information (tenure, Contract, PaperlessBilling, PaymentMethod)
  - Services subscribed (PhoneService, MultipleLines, InternetService and related add-ons)
  - Financial metrics (MonthlyCharges, TotalCharges)

The dataset provides a comprehensive view of customer attributes and behaviors that might influence churn decisions, making it suitable for developing a predictive model.

## 2. Data Preprocessing Strategy

### Data Quality Issues Identified:
- **Missing values**: 11 missing values detected in the TotalCharges column after conversion to numeric.
- **Data type conversions needed**:
  - TotalCharges needs conversion from object to numeric
  - SeniorCitizen is numeric (0/1) but represents a categorical variable
- **No duplicates or anomalies** detected in the initial analysis

### Recommended Preprocessing Steps:

1. **Handle missing values**:
   - For TotalCharges: Impute with median values based on tenure groups
   - Alternative: Remove 11 records (only 0.16% of dataset)

2. **Data type conversions**:
   - Convert TotalCharges to numeric
   - Convert SeniorCitizen to categorical (Yes/No) for consistency

3. **Feature encoding**:
   - One-hot encoding for multi-value categorical variables (Contract, InternetService, PaymentMethod)
   - Binary encoding for Yes/No variables (PhoneService, PaperlessBilling, etc.)

4. **Feature scaling**:
   - Standardize or normalize numerical features (tenure, MonthlyCharges, TotalCharges)
   - Essential for distance-based algorithms and neural networks

## 3. Feature Engineering Approaches

### New Feature Creation:

1. **Tenure-based features**:
   - Tenure groups (0-12 months, 13-24 months, etc.) - Analysis shows strong correlation with churn:
     - 0-12 months: 47.68% churn rate
     - 61-72 months: 6.61% churn rate
   - Tenure recency indicator (recent vs. long-term customer)

2. **Service-related features**:
   - Total number of services subscribed
   - Service-to-charge ratio (services per dollar)
   - Premium service flag (customers with multiple premium services)

3. **Financial features**:
   - Average monthly charge (TotalCharges/tenure)
   - Recent billing changes (if historical data becomes available)

### Feature Importance Analysis:

Based on exploratory analysis, the following features show strong predictive potential:

1. **Contract type** - dramatic impact on churn rates:
   - Month-to-month: 42.71% churn rate
   - One year: 11.27% churn rate
   - Two year: 2.83% churn rate

2. **Tenure** - strong negative correlation with churn

3. **Internet service type**:
   - Fiber optic: 41.89% churn rate
   - DSL: 18.96% churn rate
   - No internet: 7.40% churn rate

4. **Payment method** - Electronic check users show higher churn propensity

5. **Monthly charges** - Higher charges correlate with increased churn probability

## 4. Recommended Model Architecture

### Class Imbalance Handling:

With a 26.54% churn rate (1,869 'Yes' vs 5,174 'No'), I recommend:

1. **Resampling techniques**:
   - SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)
   - Random Under-sampling of majority class
   - Combination approach (SMOTE + Tomek links)

2. **Algorithm-level approaches**:
   - Class weights inversely proportional to frequencies
   - Cost-sensitive learning
   - Threshold adjustment for classification

### Model Architecture Recommendations:

1. **Baseline Models**:
   - Logistic Regression (with regularization)
   - Decision Tree (with pruning)
   - Random Forest

2. **Advanced Models**:
   - Gradient Boosting Machines (XGBoost, LightGBM)
   - Neural Network with the following structure:
     - Input layer: Matches preprocessed feature count
     - Hidden layers: 2-3 layers (128, 64, 32 neurons) with ReLU activation
     - Dropout layers (0.2-0.3) for regularization
     - Output layer: Single neuron with sigmoid activation
     - Binary cross-entropy loss function
     - Adam optimizer with learning rate scheduling
     - Early stopping to prevent overfitting

3. **Ensemble Approach**:
   - Stacking classifier combining the strengths of multiple base models
   - Voting classifier with soft voting for probability calibration

## 5. Evaluation Metrics Strategy

Given the imbalanced nature of churn prediction, accuracy alone is insufficient. Recommended metrics:

### Primary Metrics:

1. **Area Under ROC Curve (AUC-ROC)**:
   - Evaluates model performance across all classification thresholds
   - Less sensitive to class imbalance
   - Target: AUC > 0.85

2. **F1-Score**:
   - Harmonic mean of precision and recall
   - Balances false positives and false negatives
   - Critical when both precision and recall matter

### Secondary Metrics:

3. **Precision**:
   - Proportion of predicted churners who actually churn
   - Important when retention campaigns are costly

4. **Recall (Sensitivity)**:
   - Proportion of actual churners correctly identified
   - Critical when missing a potential churner is costly

5. **Precision-Recall AUC**:
   - More informative than ROC-AUC for imbalanced datasets

### Business-Oriented Metrics:

6. **Lift**:
   - Improvement over random selection for targeted campaigns

7. **Expected Value**:
   - Cost-benefit analysis incorporating:
     - Cost of retention campaign
     - Success rate of retention
     - Customer lifetime value

## 6. ML Pipeline Development Insights

### Pipeline Components:

1. **Data preprocessing**:
   - Automated pipeline using scikit-learn Pipeline and ColumnTransformer
   - Separate transformers for numerical and categorical features
   - Feature scaling and encoding

2. **Feature engineering**:
   - Automated feature creation
   - Feature selection techniques (RFE, SelectKBest)
   - Dimensionality reduction if needed (PCA)

3. **Model training and evaluation**:
   - Cross-validation (5-fold)
   - Hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV)
   - Model selection based on performance metrics

4. **Model explainability**:
   - SHAP values for feature importance
   - Partial dependence plots for feature relationships
   - Prototype-based explanations for individual predictions

### Additional Implementation Recommendations:

1. **Version Control and Experiment Tracking**:
   - MLflow for experiment management
   - DVC for dataset versioning

2. **Model Monitoring**:
   - Data drift detection
   - Model performance degradation alerts
   - Automated retraining triggers

3. **Deployment Considerations**:
   - REST API with Flask/FastAPI
   - Containerization with Docker
   - CI/CD pipeline for model updates

4. **Business Integration**:
   - Dashboard for visualization of churn risks
   - Integration with CRM for automated triggers
   - A/B testing framework for retention strategies

## Conclusion

The Telco Customer Churn dataset provides a solid foundation for developing an effective churn prediction model. By implementing the recommended preprocessing steps, feature engineering techniques, and model architecture, we can create a robust ML pipeline that accurately identifies customers at risk of churning.

Contract type, tenure, internet service type, and payment methods emerge as the strongest predictors of churn behavior. The recommended approach addresses the class imbalance challenge and focuses on business-relevant evaluation metrics to maximize the ROI of retention campaigns.

Next steps include implementing and comparing the baseline and advanced models, fine-tuning hyperparameters, and integrating the model into a comprehensive customer retention strategy framework.
