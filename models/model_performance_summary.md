## Best Performing Model

The best performing model was **Logistic Regression** with an F1 score of 0.5902.

## Model Performance Insights

- **Precision**: 0.6667 - This indicates that when the model predicts a customer will churn, it is correct about 66.7% of the time.

- **Recall**: 0.5294 - The model can identify 52.9% of all customers who will actually churn.

- **F1 Score**: 0.5902 - This is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure of model performance.

- **ROC AUC**: 0.8429 - This indicates good discrimination ability between churned and non-churned customers.

## Business Implications

1. **Early Intervention**: The model can identify 52.9% of customers who are likely to churn, allowing for targeted retention strategies.

2. **Efficient Resource Allocation**: With a precision of 0.6667, retention efforts can be focused on customers who are most likely to churn, improving the ROI of retention campaigns.

3. **Customer Lifetime Value Preservation**: By identifying at-risk high-value customers early, the company can prioritize retention efforts to preserve customer lifetime value.

## Recommendations for Implementation

1. **Deployment Strategy**: Integrate the churn prediction model into the customer management system to flag at-risk customers on a monthly basis.

2. **Threshold Tuning**: Consider adjusting the probability threshold based on business priorities (higher recall vs. higher precision).

3. **Segment-Specific Models**: Consider developing separate models for different customer segments (e.g., new vs. long-term customers) to further improve prediction accuracy.

4. **Continuous Monitoring**: Implement a monitoring system to track model performance over time and retrain as needed to maintain prediction accuracy.

5. **A/B Testing**: Test different intervention strategies on predicted churners to identify the most effective retention approaches.
